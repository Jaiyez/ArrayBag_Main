This program is a Java implementation of a bag data structure. The BagInterface defines the operations a bag can perform, such as adding, removing, and counting items. The ArrayBag class provides a concrete implementation of the bag using arrays, enabling these operations to be executed efficiently. Lastly, the TestArrayBag class is a test driver that validates the functionality of the ArrayBag by performing tests on the bag's operations, such as comparing bags, adding/removing items, and checking for equality.
